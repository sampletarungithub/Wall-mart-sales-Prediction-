The objective of this project is to forecast Walmart store sales using historical sales data and machine learning techniques to support better inventory planning and business decision-making.

Data Collection & Understanding
The dataset includes weekly sales data along with factors such as store number, department, date, holidays, temperature, fuel price, CPI, and unemployment rate.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data analysis is performed to identify sales trends, seasonality, holiday effects, and store-wise and department-wise performance patterns.

Data Preprocessing

Missing values are handled using appropriate methods.

Date features are extracted (week, month, year).

Outliers and anomalies in sales data are identified and treated.

Feature Engineering & Selection
Key features influencing sales are selected, including holiday indicators, economic factors, and seasonal variables to improve prediction accuracy.

Model Development
Machine learning and time-series models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, or ARIMA are used to forecast future sales.

Model Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R-squared to ensure reliable sales predictions.

Sales Forecasting
The trained model predicts future weekly sales at store and department levels.

Conclusion
The project helps Walmart optimize inventory management, staffing, and promotional strategies by accurately forecasting sales demand.
